					Using Canvas, create a UI that will allow the user to insert shapes such as squares and circles into the canvas and move them around when clicking on them again.
					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class="list-group-item">The user must have at least two choices for figures.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">When the user clicks on the canvas area, the selected action must be performed.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">
							<p>Selected actions include:</p>
							<p>1. Insert selected figure into the clicked location.</p>
							<p>2. If the user clicked on where a figure is already located, they must be able to drag it and change its position.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p> <strong>Patterns suggested:</strong> observer, factory, constructor, prototype, interface </p>
